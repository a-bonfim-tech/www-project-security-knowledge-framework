# Security Knowledge Framework

The **Security Knowledge Framework (SKF)** is an OWASP educational project designed to help developers, architects, and security practitioners understand secure software development principles in a structured and practical way.

SKF is **not** a vulnerability scanner or enforcement tool. Instead, it acts as a **knowledge base and learning framework**, explaining *why* security controls exist and how they relate to industry standards such as **OWASP ASVS** and **OWASP Top 10**.

---

## What this project is

* An **educational framework** for secure software development
* A **reference** for secure coding principles and security controls
* A **learning resource** for developers, students, and security teams
* A **companion project** to OWASP standards (e.g., ASVS)

## What this project is not

* Not a security scanner
* Not a CI/CD enforcement tool
* Not a replacement for code review or security testing
* Not a prescriptive framework enforcing a single SDLC methodology

---

## How to use the Security Knowledge Framework

SKF can be used in several contexts:

* **Learning & training**: understanding secure-by-design concepts
* **Architecture & design**: supporting security discussions and threat modeling
* **Development guidance**: explaining security requirements and controls
* **Education**: structured learning paths for students and teams
